#Fake News Detection 🔍📰
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fake news by analyzing patterns in text. With the rise of misinformation online, identifying fake news has become crucial in maintaining the integrity of information. The model uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms to classify news articles as either real or fake based on textual features.
